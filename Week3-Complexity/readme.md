148A - Insomnia Cure

In this case we need to find how many damaged dragon. As the problem said Every k-th dragon got punched in the face,etc.
To get the answer we will make loop for i = 1 to d.
The logic is if i %  k or l or m or n == 0 thats mean the dragon got damaged. 
So if k l m n value is 1 thats mean all the dragon damaged coz i % 1 is always 0.
In this code it the value of k l m n not meet the condition i alrdy mention above 
thats mean damaged dragon -1.

Worst Case: O(n)
Average Case: ?(n)
Best Case: O(1)
