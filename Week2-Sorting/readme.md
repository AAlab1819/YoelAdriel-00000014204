230a-Dragons

the objective of this case is kirito can beat all the dragon if he have greater power.
each dragon got different power and extra power to kirito so first things to do is sort
the dragon power from the lowest and followed by the extra power. In this case i use insertion
insertion sort start from the left side of the array so program will check if the value is lower 
the array location will be swap. After it sorted, the program will loop as much as the number of dragons
if kirito power is higher than the dragon power than kirito will get bonus power. And if kirito power after getting the 
bonus power is still lower than the dragon power  thats mean kirito fail and the output will be no.

291a- Spyke Talks 

in this case, we need to find how many chatting secretaries. If there is two same id
thats mean the secretaries is chatting but if there is more than 2 than the record is false and 
the output will be -1. In this code i use bubble sort. bubble sort is comparising each pair of elements in array
and swap them if they are not in the order until entire array is sorted. We are sorting for decreasing order
so if array[d] is bigger than array [d+1] thats mean we have to swap it. After sorting we gonna check each value 
of the array . If array not 0 and there is two same value thats mean pair +1. and if there is more than 2 than the output will be -1
after compile the program in my pc there is no error but i still got error in test 9 in codeforce. It give different output
from what my pc give.

768a- Oath of the night's watch

The objective is to find if there a number that smaller and bigger than other number. 
So we gonna sort it first. arr[0] will be the smallest number and
arr[n-1] is the biggest number. so every number that is bigger 
than arr[0] and smaller than arr[n-1] is what we need. So we will sum all the number that 
have that condition.
