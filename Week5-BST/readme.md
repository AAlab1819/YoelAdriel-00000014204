115A Party 

In this case we need to make a group where nobody is superior than other. 
First we will input the number of employee (1<=n<=2000) 
than input the status of the employee. Employee that doesnt have an immediate manager is -1.
after input we gonna check if there is -1 thats mean count ++. and after that we will compare it with current max count
if count bigger thats mean it will replace the current ans. and the final answer is the biggest ans. or the depthest root 
worst case O(n2)

4C Registration system 

in this case if there is a same string than the program will add number start from 1 in the end of the string.
first we input the number of email we want to make and we will loop it. 0 = new name. 1 = already registered
so after input the name program will check if the name is a new name than output will be ok 
and the status of the name will be 1. And if we input again a same name than the program will go to else ,where the
name will be print out with number in the end of the name.
